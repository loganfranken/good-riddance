## Good Riddance

This application pulls three images from [imgur](http://imgur.com/) and then
displays them in a slideshow set to a MIDI version of Green Day's
["Good Riddance"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnQ8N1KacJc).

### How To Use

The images are specified in a comma-delimited list within the URL hash like so:

```
http://loganfranken.github.io/good-riddance/#image_name_1.jpg,image_name_2.jpg,image_name_3.jpg
```

### Examples

* [3D Doritos Tribute](http://loganfranken.github.io/good-riddance/#k9AuQSx.jpg,lmquo5Q.jpg,BTmoIEX.jpg)

### Legal

I don't have any rights or permissions to use this song. I downloaded the MIDI
version from [free-midi.org](http://www.free-midi.org/song/green_day-time_of_your_life.html),
converted it to an MP3, and then edited it down.
